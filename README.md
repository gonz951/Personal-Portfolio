# Personal-Portfolio

## Description

This website was made to be used as the place I keep all my websites; a portfolio. 

It gave me a place to store my assignments, an opportunity to review the things I learned in the past couple weeks, and a challenge. Most of my learning was concerning CSS and links, mostly figuring out how to place everything on a page without it looking awkward. Things on this page are subject to change in the future, design-wise, but I feel satisfied for now.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
