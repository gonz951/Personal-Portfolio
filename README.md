# Personal-Portfolio

## Description

This website was made to be used as the place I keep all my websites; a portfolio. 

It gave me a place to store my assignments, an opportunity to review the things I learned in the past couple weeks, and a challenge. Most of my learning was concerning CSS and links, mostly figuring out how to place everything on a page without it looking awkward. Things on this page are subject to change in the future, design-wise, but I feel satisfied for now.

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
